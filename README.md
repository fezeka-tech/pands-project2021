# pands-project2021
This project will research and analyse Iris data. 

Iris data set is a data set that has record of 150 Iris flowers, 50 from each of the three species; versicolor, virginica and setosa. The data includes dimensions of the Iris' botanical parts, sepal and petal, in centimeters. It is used in machine learning as a discriminant analysis problem. 

The first time that Fisher presented the sepal and petal measures of the three Iris species publicly was in a 1936 report, “The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems”.
