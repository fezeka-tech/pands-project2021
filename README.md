This project will research and analyse Iris data. 

Iris data set is a data set that has record of 50 Iris, from each of the three species; versicolor, virginica and setosa. It is a discriminant analysis problem used in machine learning. 

The first time that Fisher presented the sepal and petal measures of the three Iris species publicly was in a 1936 report, “The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems”.
