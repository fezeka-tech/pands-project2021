# pands-project2021
In this project I will research, write a summary of, and analyse Iris data. I will also write a program that will output a summary of each variable to a single text file, save a hisogram of each variable to png files, and output a scatter plot of each pair of variables.

Iris data set is a data set that has record of 150 Iris flowers, 50 from each of the three species; versicolour, virginica and setosa. The data includes dimensions of the Iris' botanical parts, sepal and petal, in centimeters. It is used in machine learning as a discriminant analysis problem. 

Attribute Information:

1. sepal length in cm
2. sepal width in cm
3. petal length in cm
4. petal width in cm
5. class: -- Iris Setosa -- Iris Versicolour -- Iris Virginica

The first time that Fisher presented the sepal and petal measures of the three Iris species publicly was in a 1936 report, “The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems”.
